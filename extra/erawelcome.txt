ClimateERA is a Julia package specifically designed to automate the downloading and
analysis of reanalysis data.

This package currently supports the following reanalysis datasets:
      - ERA5 hourly data on single levels
      - ERA5 hourly data on pressure levels
      - ERA5 monthly-averaged data on single levels
      - ERA5 monthly-averaged data on pressure levels
      - ERA5 monthly-averaged hourly data on single levels
      - ERA5 monthly-averaged hourly data on pressure levels
      - ERA-Interim 6-hourly data on single levels
      - ERA-Interim 6-hourly data on pressure levels

Support for the following reanalysis datasets are planned:
      - NCEP Reanalysis II data on pressure levels
      - NCEP Reanalysis II data at surface
      - NCEP Reanalysis II data on spectral grid
      - NCEP Reanalysis II data on gaussian grid
      - MERRA2 Reanalysis on pressure levels
      - MERRA2 Reanalysis at surface

ClimateERA.jl relies heavily on the following Julia dependencies.  Please check out their
individual repositories / documentation for more information:
